# GaS_GeoT Computer Program

GaS_GeoT (Gas Geothermometers) is an application developed in the Java programming language. It includes eight new gas geothermometers (GasG\u2081 to GasG\u2088) derived for the determination of subsurface temperatures in geothermal systems. Each geothermometric equation predicts the subsurface geothermal temperature in Â°C either for liquid- or vapor-dominated geothermal reservoirs. The coefficients of the eight gas geothermometer equations were obtained from the optimization process between the artificial neural network architectures and the MCDA method.

Release Notes:
Before using the GaS_GeoT program, it is necessary to install the java virtual machine which is freely available on the following web site: https://www.java.com/es/download/
