# GaS_GeoT Computer Program

GaS_GeoT (Gas Geothermometers) is an application developed in the Java programming language. It includes eight new gas geothermometers (GasG1 to GasG8) derived for the determination of subsurface temperatures in geothermal systems. Each geothermometric equation predicts the subsurface temperature in °C either for liquid— or vapor—dominated geothermal reservoirs. The coefficients of the eight gas geothermometric equations were obtained from optimized artificial neural network architectures by using a MCDA method.

Release Notes:
Before using the GaS_GeoT program, it is necessary to install the java virtual machine which is freely available on the following web site: https://www.java.com/es/download/
