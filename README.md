# GaS_GeoT

GaS_GeoT (Gas Geothermometers) is an application developed in the Java language. It includes 8 new geothermometric equations or geothermometers (GasG1 to GasG8). Each equation estimates the temperature (Â°C) of the geothermal reservoir; based on the coefficients obtained through the implementation of artificial neural networks.

Release Notes:
