# GasGeo_v1.0
GasGeo (Gas Geothermometer) is an application developed in the Java language. It includes 8 new geothermometric equations or geothermometers (GEOG1-GEOG8). Each equation estimates the temperature (Â°C) of the geothermal reservoir; based on the coefficients obtained through the implementation of artificial neural networks.
