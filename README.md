# GaS_GeoT
GaS_GeoT (Gas Geothermometer) is an application developed in the Java language. It includes eight new geothermometric equations or geothermometers (GasG1 to GasG8). Each equation estimates the temperature (Â°C) of the geothermal reservoir; based on the coefficients obtained through the implementation of artificial neural networks.
